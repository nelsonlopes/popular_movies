This repo contains the code for the second and third projects of the Android Developer Nanodegree program at Udacity.

The application requires an API key which can be gotten on [The Movie Database Website](https://www.themoviedb.org).

Then, you must add your API key in the file gradle.properties as follows: API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
